<<<<<<< HEAD
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
=======
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.
>>>>>>> v4.9.227

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Xircom cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_XIRCOM

config PCMCIA_XIRC2PS
	tristate "Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card)
	  Ethernet or Fast Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called xirc2ps_cs.  If unsure, say N.
