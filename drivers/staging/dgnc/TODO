* remove unecessary comments
* remove unecessary error messages. Example kzalloc() has its 
  own error message. Adding an extra one is useless.
* use goto statements for error handling when appropriate
* there is a lot of unecessary code in the driver. It was 
  originally a standalone driver. Remove uneeded code.

Please send patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and
