Binding for the LTC2952 PowerPath controller

This chip is used to externally trigger a system shut down. Once the trigger has
<<<<<<< HEAD
been sent, the chips' watchdog has to be reset to gracefully shut down.
If the Linux systems decides to shut down it powers off the platform via the
kill signal.

been sent, the chip's watchdog has to be reset to gracefully shut down.
A full powerdown can be triggered via the kill signal.
>>>>>>> v4.9.227

Required properties:

- compatible:		Must contain: "lltc,ltc2952"
<<<<<<< HEAD
- trigger-gpios:	phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
			chip's trigger line
=======
>>>>>>> v4.9.227
- watchdog-gpios:	phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
			chip's watchdog line
- kill-gpios:		phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
			chip's kill line

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Optional properties:
- trigger-gpios:	phandle + gpio-specifier for the GPIO connected to the
			chip's trigger line. If this property is not set, the
			trigger function is ignored and the chip is kept alive
			until an explicit kill signal is received

>>>>>>> v4.9.227
Example:

ltc2952 {
	compatible = "lltc,ltc2952";

	trigger-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	watchdog-gpios = <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	kill-gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};
