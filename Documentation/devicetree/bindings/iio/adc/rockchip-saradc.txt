Rockchip Successive Approximation Register (SAR) A/D Converter bindings

Required properties:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- compatible: Should be "rockchip,saradc"
=======
- compatible: should be "rockchip,<name>-saradc" or "rockchip,rk3066-tsadc"
   - "rockchip,saradc": for rk3188, rk3288
   - "rockchip,rk3066-tsadc": for rk3036
   - "rockchip,rk3399-saradc": for rk3399

>>>>>>> v4.9.227
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
       region.
- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
              depends on the interrupt controller.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Shall be "saradc" for the converter-clock, and "apb_pclk" for
               the peripheral clock.
- vref-supply: The regulator supply ADC reference voltage.
- #io-channel-cells: Should be 1, see ../iio-bindings.txt

Optional properties:
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names if need support
	  this option. See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the name "saradc-apb".
