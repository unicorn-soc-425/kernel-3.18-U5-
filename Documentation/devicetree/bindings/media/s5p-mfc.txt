* Samsung Multi Format Codec (MFC)

Multi Format Codec (MFC) is the IP present in Samsung SoCs which
supports high resolution decoding and encoding functionalities.
The MFC device driver is a v4l2 driver which can encode/decode
video raw/elementary streams and has support for all popular
video codecs.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be either one among the following
	(a) "samsung,mfc-v5" for MFC v5 present in Exynos4 SoCs
	(b) "samsung,mfc-v6" for MFC v6 present in Exynos5 SoCs
	(c) "samsung,mfc-v7" for MFC v7 present in Exynos5420 SoC
	(d) "samsung,mfc-v8" for MFC v8 present in Exynos5800 SoC

  - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

  - interrupts : MFC interrupt number to the CPU.
  - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to mfc clock.
  - clock-names : from common clock binding: must contain "mfc",
		  corresponding to entry in the clocks property.

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - samsung,mfc-r : Base address of the first memory bank used by MFC
		    for DMA contiguous memory allocation and its size.

  - samsung,mfc-l : Base address of the second memory bank used by MFC
		    for DMA contiguous memory allocation and its size.

Optional properties:
  - samsung,power-domain : power-domain property defined with a phandle
			   to respective power domain.
=======
Optional properties:
  - power-domains : power-domain property defined with a phandle
			   to respective power domain.
  - memory-region : from reserved memory binding: phandles to two reserved
	memory regions, first is for "left" mfc memory bus interfaces,
	second if for the "right" mfc memory bus, used when no SYSMMU
	support is available

Obsolete properties:
  - samsung,mfc-r, samsung,mfc-l : support removed, please use memory-region
	property instead
